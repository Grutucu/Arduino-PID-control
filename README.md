# Arduino-PID-control

This is a project to utilize the arduino PID library to run a dc motor, and then graph the results of the motor response using python's pyplot.

The [arduino playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary) page for the PID library.

The original [Grett Beauregard blog post](http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginners-pid-introduction/) on PID for the arduino.

Installation and usage of python as well as pyplot is left up to you.
